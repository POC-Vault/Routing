# Routing

I put a soluton and project (asp.net core 3.1) in the "MyWebApp" folder ,
If you run it, you get to the home page .

Now , if you look at the top of the page, you see to links to the "Home" and "Privacy"

if you  click on te privacy, you will be navigated to the PRivacy page by a html link.

Now you would see a submit button that try to do a server side redirection back to the home page.
